future_picture: >-
  Arkansans and their communities are resilient to misinformation and manipulative
  influence campaigns that circulate in the information environment. 
  Individuals are not misled into harmful actions or false beliefs, 
  and they make sound, independent decisions with clarity and confidence. 
  The social fabric is grounded in trust â€” not in any one source, 
  but in the collective strength of relationships, shared understanding, 
  and a culture of critical reflection. 
  In this environment, bad-faith actors seeking to confuse, divide, 
  or destabilize the public consistently fail. 
  Over time, those behind misinformation campaigns have learned to bypass Arkansas entirely,
  recognizing that its people are simply not a useful audience for manipulation.
# Getting interns is not just random. We need to suss out matches better. The current system
# is that you submit your resume and get picked. Internships are a good way for companies to get to know their future employees. We need guidelines for internships. It should be something that should allow the intern to learn and contribute in a meaningful way. Interns should get a nominal pay that makes sense, at least to have their expenses paid for the internship, but ideally the kids get paid something.
# With AI we can do so much better in matching people who share common interests and loves -- like dogs. A platform like SkillVille as a social media platform helps people self-match affinities.
