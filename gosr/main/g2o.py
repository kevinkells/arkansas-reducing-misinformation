GOSR Workflow Phase: Goal → Obstacles

This script takes a single, user-defined Goal and generates a structured list of Obstacles
that may prevent achieving that goal. It is the first step in the GOSR (Goal-Obstacles-Solutions-Resources) pipeline.

Typical usage:
    python g2o.py <config-directory>

Inputs:
    - A directory containing a config.yaml file with the required parameters.

Outputs:
    - A structured JSON file listing obstacles related to the goal.

Reference: See the GOSR process at
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wLkb61LRHV_3o0JqQnr0yeqTPRzzKiLhw0elX2_o6M8/edit?slide=id.g1ff3a93b48e_0_5

"""
Configuration (config.yaml)
---------------------------
The following parameters are required in config.yaml for g2o.py:

- future_picture (str): 
    The main goal or vision statement to analyze.
    This is the central objective for which obstacles will be generated.

- root_node_name (str): 
    The label for the root node in the tree (usually the goal itself).
    This will be used as the root node's name in the obstacle tree structure.

- root_question (str): 
    A prompt or question to initiate obstacle generation.
    This is sent to the language model to generate the initial list of obstacles.

- locality (str): 
    The city, region, or locality for context.
    This provides local context to the language model for more relevant obstacles.

- country (str): 
    The country for context.
    This further contextualizes the goal and obstacles for the language model.

The following parameter is optional:
- major_theme_obstacles (list of str): 
    Known obstacles from the local community, included in the prompt for context if present.
    If provided, these are shared with the language model to inform or refine its generated list of obstacles.

Example config.yaml:
--------------------
future_picture: "Increase community access to healthy food"
root_node_name: "Access to Healthy Food"
root_question: "What are the main obstacles to increasing community access to healthy food?"
locality: "Springfield"
country: "USA"
major_theme_obstacles:
  - "Lack of grocery stores"
  - "Limited public transportation"
  - "High food prices"
